1. Overall, I'd say its got a good difficulty. I didn't realize you had to hold enter to stay locked on
	so I thought your game was going to be insanely difficult. 
	
2. I'm not sure what I'm going to be grappling to and sometimes it takes me to a further away pillar
	than the one I'm closer to but other than that it was fun. Maybe add some parts of your level that
	require its use to progress.
	
3. You really get pushed into the deep end with your game. Gotta ease people in otherwise they'll get destroyed
	while learning how your combat works.

4.	The enemy and player damage color stuff is a good idea for sure. The UI over the enemy you lock onto is
	also a very good idea, add this to what you're going to grapple to when you hold the button.
	
General Notes: Not gonna lie, I hate your controls. Pair that with the fact that some keyboards don't have
				the keypad on the side and you're in a world of hurt. Also, you bind the A key to something
				and the WASD keys also move your character. So maybe think about that.
