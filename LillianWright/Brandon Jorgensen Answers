1. Probably, the combat was a tad janky due to what I assume is a hitbox issue, I had no clue if I was
	actually hitting them or not. In the 2nd scene/level, I had issues with the combat. Enemies were hitting me
	despite not actually being next to them. So I had low health for most of the area and died to the Thicc one.
	
2. I wasn't aware those were suppose to be mazes so yeah I'd make those more complex, unless it was suppose	
	to be that straight forward. In that case, you're fine! The first 2 scenes/levels are probably fine in terms
	of the concepts you're throwing at them. Though that's not to say they couldn't be better in terms of
	interest or excitement.
	
3. Well, in my mind I knew that there was no path before me and I didn't see any fork in the road of sorts
	so I just assumed that if I moved forward I would be going the right way. Although I didn't necesarrily feel
	like I was being guided forward. I'd try to find a balance between having a blind fold on and GO HERE DINGUS. 
	If you can make that work with your environment or game themes then that's just bonus points.
	
4. They stood out from the rest of the level but I didn't feel like I was looking for one, I just sort of 
	found them. There's a bit of an issue where I'll be at a door and have no idea how to open it. What do
	you think would fix that issue?
	
5. I will admit, the controls for everything except for movement were very obtuse to me. I'd take a look at
	a few PC games that handle things like this. In a general sense, if the player uses WASD to move, try
	to keep all the buttons that do things around that side of the keyboard at the very least. People, myself
	included, love the E, Q, R, F and Shift keys. Never have to move my hand from the movement keys. Unless
	you want to have the other hand doing something too, in that case keep they clumped together as G, X, and
	K are somewhat spread out.
