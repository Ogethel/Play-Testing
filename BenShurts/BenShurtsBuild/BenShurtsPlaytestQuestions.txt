Ok so yeah it's not really a fun game yet mostly just a collection of systems that are starting to finally work together. Most notably all my AI broke and I haven't had time to fix it yet.
so I know it sucks right now... 

controls:
movement - WASD
take hat on/off - Q
sprint - shift

Questions:

1: How does the character controller feel?
2: what enemy behaviors would make this more difficult or fun.
3: what should the dog be able to do?
