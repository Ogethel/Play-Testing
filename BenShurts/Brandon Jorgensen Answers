1. it's a tiny bit sluggish to start moving but I know that's just a general thing with
	Input.GetAxis so thats fine I suppose.
	
2. I can't really comment on this since there isn't a lot of gameplay happening yet on the player side
	Maybe start out with some basic ones like chasing. You seem to have patrolling down so far.
	
3. Well, I think a pretty obvious one that I thought of immediately was the dog and the other character (Human?)
	are completely different sizes so play off that. Dogs love to fetch and the key location is in an area
	only the dog can reach but the human is the only one that can truly use the key like for opening doors.
