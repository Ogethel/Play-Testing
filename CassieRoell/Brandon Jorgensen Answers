1. I didn't really feel any tension in the game. The enemies were pretty easy to sneak by.

2. My light never ran out. The game was bright enough (Probably my monitor settings) where I never had to
	turn it on. I didn't feel the need to turn it on to solve any puzzle or block paths either if I needed too.
	
3. I did die. I wanted to see how much the enemies did if I were to touch them. Turns out you die very quickly.
	Like so quickly that there's no way you'll survive if they touch you unless you catch them at the end
	of their patrol round and the immediately start walking the other way.
	
4. Not very far, I gather a bunch of the light to the south east of the fire and then messed around with
	the enemies to the north.
	
Side notes: Well done Casie, I think you've got a lot done here. One little thing I will mention is when you
			make the player do some platforming, it was very difficult to get a hold of how the character is going
			to move due to the camera not being centered along with the isometric viewpoint. I had a hard
			time with that.
