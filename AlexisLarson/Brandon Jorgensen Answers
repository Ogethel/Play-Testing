1. I personally find that giving hints towards the monster or eventual danger/event to be the best way.
	Take the first Jaws movie for example. You don't see the actual shark until the last third of the movie
	yet they build the shark up so when you do see it you will be scared.
	
2. I'd say sound. Foot steps in the distance when you're suppose to be alone.

3. That would depend on your level design goals. The recent Resident Evil remakes use them as a hub of sorts.
	in RE2 remake specifically, they have safe rooms on the separate sides of the police station you play in.
	However, they eventually change this up by having the main safe room become not so safe. I don't have enough
	information about your game to give a good suggestion on this as there are a lot of factors to think about.
	
4. Honestly, none. In a larger game, you would probably hold the music back for very specific events.
	This being a horror game of sorts, I'd hold it back. Psychology wise, people for the most part don't like
	silence. It gets to them in a way some things don't. Add in some of those footsteps from 2 questions ago
	and boom. You've made them paranoid. Then once the monster reveals itself, get some energetic chasing music.
	However, you can run into the issue of boredom so make sure you don't forget ambient sounds.
	
5. So when I played the game, my assumption was that the player is holding a torch and the monster doesn't
	like the glowing crystals so I thought it was a light exposure thing. Typically, horror games don't
	let you attack the monsters that you face unless its a survival game and this seems more horror than
	survival, so I'd say maybe have it as a sort of defense item and once the torch burns out, they're vulnerable.
