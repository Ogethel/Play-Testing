1. 4.

2. I did read the How To.

3. 7. I didn't see the button in the corner to switch the controls and I didn't know why that purple thing
	was there until I pressed said button.
	
4. 1. I didn't really have to care too much about how close I got because it seems the player has a large
	range in which they can attack. If I knew what I know now after the first play through, I'd probably never
	get touched. Also, man do those ghosts have a ton of health,  that or your graphic may be broken.
	They seem to flash red even when I'm not in range whenever I click.
	
5. 9. Player seemed to move how I expected it to once I got used to the move speed (blame everyone elses game).

6. Every environment I was in seemed to work the way it was suppose to.

7. I didn't die :)

8. 6. The environment was somewhat interesting but was very flat. The best area was definitely the puzzle room.

9. My favorite thing was the first puzzle. My least favorite thing was also the first puzzle. I like how
	you solve it. however, you never teach the player about any of the mechanics going on like the switches,
	swapping bodies/controls, or why they're there in the first place. My other least favorite thing was the enemies.
	At the very least, they're very boring and not challenging.
