1. I didn't feel suspense at any part of the game.

2. The light orb puzzle at the beginning.

3. Any section that wasn't the town or the light orb puzzle.

4. Attacking was something I never learned (I didn't talk to anyone in town because eww being social)

5. I didn't really struggle or die.

6. That movement speed is insane, like they should make a sonic movie about this guy instead levels of fast.
	The puzzle was weird. I was taught how to turn the lights on but not what I was suppose to do. It wasn't
	really a puzzle from that perspective, just a task.
