1. The first area of combat just has you swarmed with 5+ enemies in one area. Learning combat here is going
	to be incredibly rough and overwhelming. I'd like to have more areas to be in and I see the areas beyond the
	combat section but I can't seem to get there? The controls were interesting. I've never had a game tell me to use J and K before to do attacks so that was
	a little awkward for me.
	
2. The little sign posts you put up for things is nice. Adds some interaction to your level which people love.
	The lack of being able to fight back was a bit annoying but when you die you don't get set too far back.
	
3. There isn't enough gameplay here for me to get a full grasp of what your game has to offer for me to 
	suggest new mechanics, sorry.
