1. Not really, no. Once you get to the Arena area, you have 2 ways to go and I dont really have a clue
	why I'm here or what i'm suppose to do.
	
2. Very much yes. You have a very Bulletstorm-like opportunity here. If you haven't seen Bulletstorm, its an FPS
	where the player is scored for each level based on how creatively they killed the enemies. I think you could,
	and honestly should, get really creative with the ricochet bullets. That and like 10x the enemies because
	they weren't a challenge at all since they're somewhat slow and are killed with 1 shot.
	
3. There were puzzles? I had no clue honestly. I just ran around shooting things and exploring.

4. The player controls were alright. It felt weird because of the VPN but I can image this runs well.

5. I'm not 100% sure what you mean by progresses. What I will say is, the platforming feels weird. That could
	be the VPN causing that or it could be the game, i'm not 100% sure. The other areas were cool. I like
	your height variance, but the level just needs more to do, be it puzzles or combat.
	
You're killing it McKade, You've got a nice game going here.
