1. 2. I just kinda wiggled my sword and enemies and they disappeard. Definitely not a murderer. Never had
	to use the shield either.
	
2. 3. The intro was very straight forward so there wasn't really any looking. Once you get to the push block
	area, thats when the issues could pop up. I have previous experience to tell me where to go fortunately.
	
3. 4. As someone who plays PC games regularly, the Attack, Defend, and Grab controls were very strange to me.
	Games typically don't use those keys for major mechanics like yours.
	
General Notes: I was able to test the block like you wanted. I was able to grab and it parented to me and moved
				with me, along with its rotation. I was then able to release it just fine. I was able to don
				other abilities like attacking and defending while holding the cube as well.
