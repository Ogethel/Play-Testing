FEEDBACK: 
1) Did you feel like your ability to control the player was unusable/inadequate?
A. I absolutely do not feel that your control scheme at the moment is unusable. 
However, I think that you can go 1 of 2 ways with your controls as they stand right now (There are obivously more but for the moment this is what I could think of).
Direction 1: Keep the controls scheme mostly the same 
Minor tweek: Make it so that the location that you last aimed is the direction your bar is facing by default for your next shot
Minor tweek: I feel like pressing and holding shift so that the power goes up and down in a cycle and you just let go when you like the power is right.
I just think there are too many buttons to press right now.
Minor tweek: Make it so I can press and hold W & A to adjust the aiming.  
I feel like that right now your game feels more stragegic.  Especially since if you get stuck by an enemy you lose because you are frozen and can no longer move.
However, I suggested the above changes in the hope that if that is the direction you were hopeing to go in, that you can also
Direction 2: Switch aiming to be mouse guided

2) Did you feel like you were guided through the level as you played and didn't struggle with being lost?

3) Were the enemies enough to keep you on edge while being attacked or it was too easy?

4) Did you enjoy playing or were you struggling to get through it?
