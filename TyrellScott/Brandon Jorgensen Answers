1. Having to use A and D to rotate the boulder felt clunky.The speed stuff felt a little unintuitive but I do 
	like the idea. (Where's my mouse controls tyrell :P)

2. The level seems very straight forward.

3. Quite the opposite, I couldn't get past the first area due to losing control of the boulder
	once you get into an enemy's range.
	
4. The concept is there. It's too slow for my liking in its current state but overall it could be good.
