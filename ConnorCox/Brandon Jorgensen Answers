1. The Camera height and angle is good. I did have issues seeing the second red key in the second area until
	I got to the door that needed it, which was a little rough.
	
2. I think it's alright, however, with the VPN and the latency it was very difficult to judge that.

3. With the bots one-shotting you if they catch you, its a little unforgiving if you're going for a 
	easier than usual game.
	
4. My assumption is you can't go upstairs due to a chair you can't pick up (Is this intentional? it's the
	same color as the jars so I assumed I could pick it up but just couldn't) so you have to go and explore.
	the other path is blocked by a robot so all that's left is to try and get the key on top of the fireplace
	for something.
