1. So the movement controls are very ARPG so I'd try to add the ability to just hold down left click
	to continuely move in that direction. Some UI would be cool as well.
	
2. I had no clue how much health I had so I felt invinicible and just charged at everyone so I'm not really
	sure how concerned I should of been. so I'm going to say there was no challenge until the orange guys
	seemingly one-shot me.
	
3. Enemies seem to act the exact same way except for movement speed. Maybe damage as well but like I said
	in the previous question, I have no clue due to no UI.
