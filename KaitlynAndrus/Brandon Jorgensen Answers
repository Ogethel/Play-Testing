1. I understood the mechanics, I think the way you physically teach the player needs some work.
	Specifically the hole digging mechanic. Typically the stages of teaching a mechanic goes the intial
	moment which is safe and meerly shows the player the mechanic and what it does. The game then makes the
	player do it again, with a slight punishment should they fail like a play missing a jump so they fall in
	a hole and have to climb out and try again. Then the third time there's some form of danger like failing
	the jump and falling to your death or taking actual damage. Your game jumps straight to the third stage.
	
2. I don't think there were any areas that felt too repetitive.

3. My assumption is you'll have to build the bridges and ladders to continue with the game so I'll say yes
	only because you have to. If the game stays in its current state then no, I'd probably just skip over them myself.
	
General Notes: The game seems interesting enough. Though a theme I've been seeing with all the games is
				a lack of verticality in the environments. Shaking up the height in which the player is at
				can keep their attention rather than them getting bored. Another thing is the music, I like it
				but it was so energetic that it made me feel like I had to keep going and at a fast pace
				when the gameplay doesn't really seem to be built around that idea. Looks good so far, keep it up!
